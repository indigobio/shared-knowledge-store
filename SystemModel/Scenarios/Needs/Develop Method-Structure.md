As a [[Builder]], I need a way 
* to construct a method from a data source so I don't have to do it by hand.
* to update an existing method from a data source so I can easily absorb changes made in the data system to existing AQ work.
* to represent the relationships between traces in a method so that it can improve the presentation and implicit behaviors of related traces within the system.
#### AQ Supporting Features
* AQUA GUI
* ACER
* Assay Gen Tool (internal)
* Excel based assay editor tool (internal)
#### A-Ha
* AQ-40 Compound type designation
* AQ-143 Extend SSC/ASC approach to qualitative results
