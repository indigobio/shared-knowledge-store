*verb*. Selecting a specific flag description, commonly used to indicate agreement with the flag value while retaining the current Reporting category. This selection will drive the flag to “go to gold” and place a goldenrod background color on the flag text. A determination will “go to green” if all flags are acknowledged. 

Acknowledging a flag is an internal ASCENT selection and not part of the disposition. Agreeing to acknowledge the ion ratio flag would be an example.
