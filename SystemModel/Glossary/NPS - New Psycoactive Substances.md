New Psychoactive Substances are drugs that have been designed to produce similar effects to controlled drugs but are structurally different enough to avoid classification under existing drug laws. They are sometimes referred to as “legal highs,” although many are now illegal.

**Challenges**
- Detection: NPS are often not detectable with standard drug screens.
- Variety and Evolution: New compounds emerge rapidly, making it hard for tests to stay current.
- Low Concentration: They may be present in very small amounts, requiring sensitive instrumentation.
