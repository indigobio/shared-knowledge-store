3. How does your work interface with the QA department?
	4. Inputs / outputs / deliverables
4. Describe the process of assay development.
	5. Where is the bulk of the work: prep, measurement, analysis, documentation?
		1. Work in phases, layering in per compound / per processing step / using some other way to break up the assay development process.
		2. Prep
			1. How you know prep is working as expected? 
			2. How much is the prep process locked/verified before moving on to measurement debugging?
		2. How do you know measurement is working as expected?
		3. At what point do you start integrating an in development assay into the larger lab information system?
	6. What strategies do you use from analysis to help tune prep / measurement?
5. How does the equipment you use differ from the equipment used in production?
	1. Are prep methods always automated?
6. What are some common problems when scaling an assay in production to multiple instruments? multiple labs?

	1. Design problem
	2. Prep problem
	3. Measurement problem
	4. Analysis problem
8. Are the same samples grouped the same on the batch throughout the whole prep through measure process?
