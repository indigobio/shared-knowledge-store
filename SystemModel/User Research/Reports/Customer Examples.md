## System Maintenance tracking
Customers log system maintenance activities to support good laboratory practice. Examples of record keeping that may be completed either on paper or digitally. 
* System Maintenance for Prelude and Sciex instrument [[2025 VLX_Prelude & Sciex Maintenance Log DALTXF110(1.0)_Template.pdf]]
* Consumable usage [[2025 Reagent Verification DALPDMF018 V1.0_ Sailor Moon.pdf]]
## Run tracking
* Run/batch reference materials' lots and levels are captured on a traveling worksheet - it begins with the specimens being aliquoted ('poured off') into tubes suitable for the next device, and travels with the set of samples through each physical (value transforming) step.  Every step has some type of inspection and sign-off, from sample into the lab for screening/confirmation until result release to LIS.  The completed form is one of the "table of contents" which goes into the hardcopy batch package which is stored.

## Providence reports
* Of note in both examples, there are only calibration curves generated for the analytes.  In our current archive file, we include that element for internal standards (and I can't recall, but it may be essentially 'plot not valid', so not useful and potentially an alarming distraction).  In the Compound (Cal/QC) Scope, we do have a graphical representation, would might be a better option, if we did want to offer it (e.g. "select your blocks" type of report construction

* Below is another example of a full batch output file, similar in content/style to a litigation package but still missing some content (e.g. audit trail; method information); the internal standard batch summary section would not be needed in a litigation package, provided the sample's specific internal standard results and performance against rules was noted.  Like the archive, this one could/would be parsed apart to generate a single sample (and perhaps even a single analyte in a single sample) litigation report.
